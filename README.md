# odin-dashboard

Welcome to my new project! This time I'm making a dashboard using a mix of `Grid` and `Flex`. The objective is to replicate this reference image:

It looks simple but already can see the challenges. I've been planning how to achieve something like this, scribbling on it with MS-Paint:

At the left I marked my guessings. I've drawn lines over the original image to get a better idea of how I should divide everything. Sorry in advance for my handwriting with mouse.

At the right there's a simplified version I drew, to make it easier to understand what I had planned: at the top there is the basic structure: nav bar, header, main and whatever you call the announcements and trending section. at the bottom I added the divisions on each main section, using orange for `Grid` and blue for `Flex`.

First I was messing around, scribbling all over the reference image, but I ended with something that I'm pretty sure will make the developing smoother, so that's a good start.

There's no need to replicate the image as is. I'm not sure if I'm going to do it, but maybe it would be the best, because in a real job I guess I'll be following the UX/UI team's design instead of making my own.

As always, I'll be updating this README.md file with my progress. I've said in my [previous repository](https://github.com/HectorVilas/odin-form) that I will write everything on spanish (my native language) and english, but that was a lot of unnecesary extra work, so I'll stick with english only, at least for Odin's practice projects.
